# 🎨 AI Color Palette Generator

Hi there! 👋  
This is a simple and fun web app I built that lets you **extract color palettes** from any image you upload. 
Whether you're a designer, a developer, or just someone who loves playing with colors — this might be useful (and maybe even a little inspiring ✨).

## 💡 What it does
  
- You upload an image (JPG/PNG)
- It scans the **entire image** and picks out the most dominant colors using AI (KMeans clustering)
- You get a neat little color palette with **hex codes**
- You can even **download** the palette as a PNG!
